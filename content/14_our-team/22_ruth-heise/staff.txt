Description:

Ruth’s role at YU is Team Shepherd/Chaplain to three of our larger staff teams. It is a role of journeying with staff as they minister to youth on the frontlines. After 30 years on the frontlines, Ruth knows how valuable it is to have someone walk with you to work through the heart and faith journey of ministry.
She sees this role as three fold:
* Bringing people to prayer
* Bringing people to God’s word
* Helping staff pause in their work. Taking time to think, feel, reflect and then bring it all to our God who knows and cares.
