Description: Betty coordinates, plans and organizes the activities for our Seeds of Hope programs. They provide a place where all participants experience the love of God in life transforming ways. This includes the summer day and overnight camp, and the Seeds of Hope After School club. In addition, she facilitates weekly mentorship programs for Seeds of Hope Moms, and a program for girls in partnership with Lisle Memorial Baptist Church in the Jane Finch community. These evangelistic and discipleship programs seek to build leadership skills of our youth and to encourage the campers and their families in faith and family life.
