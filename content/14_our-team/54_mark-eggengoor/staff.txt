Description: Mark grew up in the landscape horticulture profession and operated a successful business for over 30 years. In the last couple of years, he has been thinking and dreaming about serving God through mentoring youth in the workplace. Through a series of what he believes are God-led events, he met up with Youth Unlimited (YU). With the help of YU, they decided on a property services social enterprise as a platform to engage and employ youth while steadfastly offering and modeling Godâ€™s life-changing message.
