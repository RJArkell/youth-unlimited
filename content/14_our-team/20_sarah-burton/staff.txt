Description:

I have had numerous opportunities as a student to serve in Scarborough and the Dominican Republic with DOXA. God used these mission experiences to deeply impact my life and has used them as a catalyst for me to join the DOXA team!

My role with YU is training and mentoring of students and volunteers, and planning of future DOXA Journeys trips. I have a heart for the youth of our city and I love to see students encounter God in a new way as they learn to be “globally conscious and locally active”.
