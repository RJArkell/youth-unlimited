Description: Mark Dean co-ordinates The Shop program, a dynamic youth training center that spreads the word of God through working one to one with youth on projects. We work with youth ages 15 to 20 who are in trouble with the law, parents, high school and themselves. We mentor them in life skills using the avenue of auto mechanics, small engine mechanics and carpentry. This program has lead to many youth hearing for the first time Godâ€™s story and how it relates to their current life situations.
