Description: Clem started off with Youth Unlimited in 2011, teaching bicycle mechanics and mentoring youth in Willowdale. As the Jane & Finch Community Director, Clemâ€™s role is to lead, support and develop staff, volunteers, and ministries in the Jane & Finch neighbourhood. Our team sees Jane & Finch as a community full of hope and potential. We are committed to being a steady presence in the neighbourhood, journeying alongside youth and families as they experience God's transformative love. Our hope is that one day they themselves will become stewards of God's hope and love within this community and beyond.
