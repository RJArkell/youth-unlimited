Description: Ben has been serving in the Jane-Finch Community, as part of the Youth Unlimited team, since 2003. The youth he knows in the community call him “Uncle Ben”. This symbolizes the privilege he has being a father figure in the lives of so many young men and women, who haven’t had the experience of growing up in a home with a loving and present father. To connect with youth and share the good news of God’s Kingdom, Ben coordinates the Hoop 2 Hope Basketball program and Seeds of Hope Summer Day Camp. At each of these programs, he meets young people where they are, and creates a bridge whereby he can walk alongside them during the often difficult years of growing up.
