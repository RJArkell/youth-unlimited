Description: Dave has had the opportunity to serve young people and their families in the Chester Le/Bridletowne Circle for the last 16 years. He does this primarily by building relationships of trust through sports, mentoring, prison ministry and bringing them up to his farm/3D archery course outside of Toronto. His goal is to show the love of Jesus, share his Message of reconciliation and forgiveness and help our students become better people/athletes/citizens of Canada.
