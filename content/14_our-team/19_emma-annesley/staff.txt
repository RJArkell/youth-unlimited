Description:

David and Emma came to Toronto as missionaries to serve children and youth living in government housing communities in 2008 and 2007, respectively. They continue to serve those living in vulnerable and marginalised communities sharing the love and hope they’ve found in knowing Christ.

Emma, as Young Moms Leader, supports, encourages and walks with parenting young women, ages 15-25, on their journey towards health and wholeness and an identity rooted in Christ.
