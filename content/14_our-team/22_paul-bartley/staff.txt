Description:

For most of his life, Paul has been working with and serving youth in some capacity in the community in which he lives. It is his goal to partner with youth and help them reach their full life potential.

As a Community Youth Mentor, Paul runs two programs in the Jane-Finch area to reach out to the youth, and also focus on dedicated one-on-one mentoring time. Iron Fruits is a fitness mentoring program that teaches character skills through the discipline of fitness. There is also the Hoop 2 Hope basketball program, which has over 60 young men attending on Friday and Saturday nights. Through this program, boys are ushered along their journey to manhood, by mentoring, field trips, and sports activities. Paul is also our Mentor Specialist for the newly launched BECC internship program. Here, he is walking closely with our three interns to help guide and develop their growth into young community leaders.
