Description: Katie is the volunteer leader at our Etobicoke Young Moms Group. Katie knows first-hand the unique and sometimes isolating struggle of being a young mother, having been one herself. Having experienced the life-altering impact of God’s grace, she feels called to share this, specifically with other mothers. She is passionate about bringing back a sense of “village” to parenting and is excited to see God work in and through the lives of the women attending and leading the South Etobicoke Young Moms group.
