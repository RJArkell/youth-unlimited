Name: Frontiers

Lefttext: The Frontiers team at YU is a collection of unique and fearless frontliners on a mission to carry out God's will throughout the city.

----

Righttext: The Frontiers team is home to a diverse group of ministries, spread across the GTA, that are comprised of 1 or 2 staff.  It is also the place where ministries that are new to YU go to find support and structure as they grow into self-sustaining programs - sort of like a ministry incubator.
