  slide1heading: The "Canvas of Transformation"
  slide1text: >
    At YU, we imagine transformation as God
    at work as a compassionate artist,
    painting on the canvas of both lives and
    neighbourhoods over time. We envision
    the colour palette having YU’s 5
    Primary Colours, from which any
    combination of colours can be created.
    As we invest in youth wholeness in this
    context, we believe we will continue to
    see this ‘Canvas of Transformation’
    come to life in young people, their
    families, and their neighbourhoods. This
    is transformed youth transforming our
    city.

    ***Engaging Life with Jesus***
    
    As young people grow in their journey of faith, the roots of their identity grow down deeply into a firm foundation. We envision young people finding contentment, building a healthy self-image, depending on God, and finding forgiveness, freedom, and healing.

    ***Growing in Virtue***
    
    In an increasingly connected world, we know character matters more than ever. Just like fruit in an orchard, God grows in our young people virtues such as love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, humility, goodness, and gentleness. Young people with these virtues can truly change our world.

    ***Putting Others First***
    
    We rejoice in seeing young people serve others, putting the needs of others before themselves. A mop and bucket symbolizes the humble acts of kindness we aim to nurture in our youth throughout the city. We believe our young people will discover lasting joy through a life of service for others.

    ***Discovering & Utilizing Gifts & Abilities***
    
    We believe every one of us has been given specific gifts, skills, and passions through which we find confidence and purpose. When young people find their 'sweet spot', it renews a sense of hope and direction, and everyone around them benefits.

  heading: Our History
  text: 'Youth Unlimited (originally Youth For Christ) was launched in 1944. Inspired by YFC rallies in Chicago, our roots in Toronto began with hosting large youth rallies at Massey Hall. These became some of the largest youth gatherings in the world at the time. Since then, YU’s entrepreneurial spirit has led us through a series of strategic shifts that clearly exemplifies our motto:  “Anchored to the Rock but geared to the times.”  Over the past 75 years our approach has developed to include weekly community clubs, proactive outreach programs, and neighbourhood-focused church partnerships.'

  heading: Making Space Strategy
  text: >
    We launched our 4-year strategic plan,
    Making Space, in 2019 after an extensive
    organization-wide discernment journey.
    Making Space is shaping our focus in
    every one of our initiatives, for every
    one of the young people we love and
    serve. Our strategic plan has four main
    areas of focus, or pathways, guiding us
    in this season.
